# address-verification

The xTuple ERP Address Validation package is an extension to xTuple
ERP that allows dynamic checking and updating of addresses, typically
using web services APIs.

## Installation

This extension has not yet been formally released (Oct 2018). There
is a pre-release package build in the `packages` directory. If you
want the latest code, you can [build the Updater package yourself](#building).

After the extension has been released you will be able to download
the Updater package from [GitHub](https://github.com/xtuple/address-verification/releases),
SourceForge.  or xTuple's [commercial-downloads](https://xtuple.org/webfm)

## Building

This is typically necessary if you are a developer about to release
a new version of the address-verification extension:

```
Linux$ cd address-verification
Linux$ make
```

This creates an Updater package in the `packages` directory.
